    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an example of programmatic use of `BLAST` to solve a biological problem: which gene features in a set of organisms are likely to be *orthologues*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term *orthologue* originally applied to features that derived from a common ancestor, and diverged through speciation. Where an unambiguous sequence counterpart can be identified in each of two diverged organisms, this may be taken to imply that the sequences are *orthologues*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![orthologues diverge by speciation](images/05-01_orthologues.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "<div class=\"alert-warning\">\n",
    "An assumption can be made that the function carried out by that feature was important in the ancestor, and is also important in its descendents (that is why the feature is retained). It can also be assumed that the function of that feature is broadly conserved, and that is why the feature is retained (this is known as \"The Orthologue Conjecture\").\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Biology is rarely that simple, however. In reality, gene duplication and gene transfer events complicate the picture. Gene duplication results in two copies of a gene being made, theoretically allowing the function of one to diverge. This may occur multiple times, and any (or no) copies may be retained. Alternatively, gene transfer from one organism to another may displace the inherited gene, or make it appear as though a gene was acquired through inheritance when it was not.\n",
    "\n",
    "![paralogues diverge by duplication](images/05-02_paralogues.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these and other complication, the identification of *reciprocal best hits* for gene products is a good first approximation to the identification of *orthologues* in two or more organisms. It forms the basis for many orthology-finding tools, such as `MCL`, `OrthoMCL` and `OrthoFinder`. It can be carried out by carrying out `BLAST+` searches using a short program, and this will be illustrated below.\n",

    "<b>Differences in the composition of gene complements (e.g. presence/absence of *orthologues*) my support hypotheses for functional or phenotypic differences, and identify characteristic signals for diagnostics and epidemiology.
