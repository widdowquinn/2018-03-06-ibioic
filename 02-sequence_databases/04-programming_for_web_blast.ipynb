    "\n",
    "This notebook presents examples of methods for using `BLAST` programmatically, with the webservice provided by NCBI. All calculations will be run on NCBI's servers, using NCBI's databases (not your local `BLAST` installation), but you will be controlling the search using Python code in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages to using a programmatic interface for remote BLAST queries are the same as those listed in [notebook 03](03-programming_for_blast):\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is easy to set up repeatable searches for many sequences, or collections of sequences\n",
    "* It is easy to read in the search results and conduct downstream analyses that add value to your search\n",
    "\n",
    "Where it is be practical to submit a large number of simultaneous queries via a web form (because it is tiresome to point-and-click over and over again), this can be handled programmatically instead. You have the opportunity to change custom options to help refine your query, compared to the website interface. If you need to repeat a query, it can be trivial to get the same settings every time, if you use a programmatic approach."

    "As in [notebook 03](03-programming_for_blast.ipynb), our first worked example will be to run a `BLASTX` search, querying a nucleotide sequence against a protein database, to identify potential homologues. What is different about this search is that we will be conducting it at NCBI, and using a different database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use `Biopython` in the code blocks below to first perform the same `BLASTX` search you carried out in the exercise from [notebook 01](01-blast_at_NCBI_website.ipynb) - query a lantibiotic biosynthesis protein from *Kitasatospora* against other *Kitasatospora* species, and write the results to file. Then we will parse the results into a `pandas` dataframe, and finally plot some summary statistics using `seaborn`."

    "2. Run a remote job with the `NCBIWWW.qblast()` method, specifying your query sequence, database, and `BLAST` program\n",
    "3. Parse the output you get back from NCBI\n",
