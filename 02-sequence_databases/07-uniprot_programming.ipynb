    "The `UniProt` browser interface is very powerful, but you will have noticed that even the most complex queries can be converted into a single string that describes the search being made of the `UniProt` databases. This string is generated for you, and placed into the search field at the top of the `UniProt` webpage every time you run a search.\n",

    "<b>It can be tedious and time-consuming to point-and-click your way through a large number of browser-based searches, but by using the `UniProt` webservice, the search strings you've already seen, and a Python module called `bioservices`, we can compose and run as many searches as we like using computer code, and pull the results of those searches.</b>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents examples of methods for using `UniProt` programmatically, via a webservice, and you will be controlling the searches using Python code in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of advantages to this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is easy to set up repeatable searches for many sequences, or collections of sequences\n",
    "* It is easy to read in the search results and conduct downstream analyses that add value to your search\n",
    "\n",
    "Where it is not practical to submit a large number of simultaneous queries via a web form (because it is tiresome to point-and-click over and over again), this can be handled programmatically instead. You have the opportunity to change custom options to help refine your query, compared to the website interface. If you need to repeat a query, it can be trivial to get the same settings every time, if you use a programmatic approach."
